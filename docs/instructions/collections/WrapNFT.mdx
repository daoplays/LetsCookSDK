# WrapNFT Instruction

The WrapNFT instruction allows users to wrap (lock) their NFT from a specific collection in exchange for tokens. If no specific NFT is provided, the instruction will randomly select one from the user's owned NFTs in the collection.

## Optional Transfer Hook Accounts

If the token has a transfer hook, these additional accounts are required:

| Index | Name                     | Type    | Properties | Seeds                                 |

| 14    | Transfer Hook Program    | Program | isWritable | -                                     |
| 15    | Transfer Hook Validation | PDA     | isWritable | `["extra-account-metas", token_mint]` |
| 16+   | Extra Hook Accounts      | Various | Various    | Determined by transfer hook           |

## Instruction Data

| Field      | Type | Description           |
| ---------- | ---- | --------------------- |
| instruction| u8   | Instruction index for wrap_nft |

## Implementation Details

The instruction performs the following operations:

1. If no specific NFT is provided (`asset_key === null`):
   - Queries all NFTs from the collection owned by the user
   - Randomly selects one NFT from the valid assets
   - Uses the selected NFT's public key as the `wrapped_nft_key`

2. Derives all necessary PDAs and associated token accounts

3. If the token has a transfer hook:
   - Derives the transfer hook validation account
   - Resolves any extra account metas required by the hook
   - Adds these accounts to the instruction

4. Creates and returns the transaction instruction with the serialized instruction data

## Usage Example

```typescript
const instruction = await GetWrapNFTInstruction(
    collectionData,
    mintData,
    userPublicKey,
    null, // Random NFT selection
    connection
);
```
